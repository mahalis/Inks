Hi! Thanks for downloading my game. I made it in 48 hours, working alone, for the Ludum Dare 48 “compo” challenge. You can rate it and let me know what you think over here:

You can find me on Twitter at @mahalis or by email at mahalis@gmail.com.

All the art and sound was made from scratch, using the following:

• Unreal Engine
• Substance Designer
• GarageBand
• Audacity

The title is set in Mont by Fontfabric (https://www.fontfabric.com/fonts/mont/) and the menu text is set in Louis George Cafe by Chen Yining (yiningchen23@gmail.com).


How to Play

Chase smaller / paler blots of ink and avoid larger / deeper ones. Your prey are green; your predators are purple. Consume everything to win.

To move, use the mouse cursor, WASD, the arrow keys, or either thumbstick on a game controller.
